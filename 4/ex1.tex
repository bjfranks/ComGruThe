\section{Strong generating set}
\subsection*{a)}
Let $s_1 = (1,8)(2,5)(3,6)$, $s_2 = (1,4,8,7)(2,6)(3,5)$ and $s_3 = (1,7)(8,4)(2,5,3,6)$ and let $G \leq S_8$ be the group generated by $S = \{s_1,s_2,s_3\}$.

We use the Schreier-Sims Algorithm to compute a base $B$ and a strong generating set $S^\prime$ relative to $B$ for $G$.

At the beginning we have $B = ()$ and $S^\prime = \{\}$. We set $M = \{s_1, s_2, s_3\}$ and sift all elements of $M$ successively. The sift algorithm with certificate returns $(s_1,1)$, $(s_2,1)$ and $(s_4,2)$, where $s_4 = (2,3)(4,7)$. After that we have $B = (1,2)$ and $S^\prime = \{s_1,s_2,s_4\}$. Then we compute the Schreier generators and add the elements $v_1 = (2,5)(3,6)(4,7)$, $s_4$ and $v_2 = (4,7)(5,6)$ to $M$. For the added elements sifting returns $(v_1,2)$, $(e,3)$ and $(v_2,3)$. Now we have $B = (1,2,4)$ and $S^\prime = \{s_1,s_2,s_4,v_1,v_2\}$. The computation of Schreier generators does not result in new elements that are not already in $M$. Thus, $B$ is a base and $S^\prime$ a strong generating set relative to $B$. The final orbits are $\Delta^{(1)} = \{1,4,7,8\}, \Delta^{(2)} = \{2,3,5,6\}$ and $\Delta^{(3)} = \{4,7\}$ with transversals $U^{(1)} = \{e, s_2, s_2^3, s_1\}, U^{(2)} = \{e, s_4, v_1, s_4 v_1\}$ and $U^{(1)} = \{e, v_2\}$.

\subsection*{b)}
As we have seen in the lecture, the order of $G$ is equal to the following product:
\[ |G| = |\Delta^{(1)}| \cdot |\Delta^{(2)}| \cdot |\Delta^{(3)}| = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 = 32. \]

\subsection*{c)}
Let $\pi = (1,4)(8,7)(2,5,6,3)$. Then sifting returns $(3,6,5) \neq e$, which implies that $\pi \notin G$.

Let $\pi = (1,8)(4,7)(2,6,3,5)$. Then sifting returns $e$ and chooses transversal elements $u_1 = s_1$, $u_2 = s_4$ and $u_3 = e$. Thus, we have $\pi = s_4 s_1 \in G$.
