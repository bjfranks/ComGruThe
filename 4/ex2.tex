The fastest know algorithm for determining whether two groups given by multiplication tables are isomorphic, given no other assumptions is $\mathcal{O}(n^{\log(n)+\mathcal{O}(1)})$. This algorithm was apparently given by some mysterious person named Tarjan. \cite{miller1978n}

Algorithms have to be fast. This is and most likely will be true for the foreseeable future. This means techniques to reduce run-time are favorable. Group-Isomorphy is one of the most basic tasks in computation, and reducing runtimes for isomorphy is thus a preferred avenue. We propose a novel method to reduce the $n\log(n)$ runtimes to linear runtimes. Previous runtimes are based on the fact that a group of n elements is generated by $\log(n)$ elements. Using properties of the Schreier Sims algorithm we make use of transversals and the orbit stabilizers to check group isomorphy without having to check each generator, allowing us to surpass the previous runtimes.
