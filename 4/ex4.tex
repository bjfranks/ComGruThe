\section{Magic Solid}

\subsection*{a)} I got the tetra, it has 4 faces and 9 parts per face. Its rotations are 2 along each of its axis, which it has 4 of. We enumerate each face for the computations by counting from left to right and top to bottom, then we enumerate the left, then the right, and then the bottom(inverted).

\subsection*{b) and c)}

In short the probabilities are $\frac{1}{8}$ for a).

And $\frac{6561}{223466169440263750} \equiv 2.94*10^{-14}$ for b)
