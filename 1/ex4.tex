\section{Subgroups of minimal index}
Assumptions $G \leq H$, $|H|=p$, $G$ finite, $p$ is smallest prime divider of $|G|$

Since $|H|=p$ and $H$ is a group and every subgroup of $H$ would divide $|H|=p$, obviously $H$ must be cyclic, otherwise there would be one element $k$ for which $<k>$ is less than $|H|$ and divides $|H|$, which is contradictory.

Since $H$ is cyclic $H$ is abelian.

We show $(gh)^{-1}=h'g^{-1}$ for $h,h' \in H$ and $h^{-1}=h'$

Proof: $gg^{-1}=e=gc^{p}g^{-1}=gc^{i}c^{p-i}g^{-1} \rightarrow (gc^i)^{-1}=c^{p-i}g^{-1}$. Since each element in $H$ has an equivalent form as $c^i$ for some $i$ the statement follows.

From this we get $ghg^{-1} = h'g^{-1}g^{-1} \in Hg^{-1}g^{-1}$ thus $gHg^{-1}=Hg^{-1}g^{-1}$. Since $e$ is in $Hg^{-1}g^{-1}$ it follows that $gg \in H$ and $g^{-1}g^{-1} \in H$, however $g^{-1}g^{-1} \in Hg^{-1}g^{-1}=gHg^{-1}$. Since cosets must be distinct or equal, $gHg^{-1}=H$
