\subsection*{b) Determine the possible orders of elements in $S_8$}
	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,15. 1-8 from cycles. 10 from a 2- and 5-cycle. 12 from a 3- and 4-cycle. 15 from a 3- and 5-cycle.

\subsection*{c) Determine the possible orders of elements in $A_5$}
	1,2,3,5. 1 from the identity. 2 from 2 2-cycles. 3 from a 3-cycle. 5 from a 5-cycle.
