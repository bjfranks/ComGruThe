\section{Subgroups of dihedral groups}

Determine all subgroups of $D_n$ and, for each of them, whether it is normal. For the normal subgroups determine the isomorphism type of the corresponding factor group.

The subgroups of $D_n$ are described, by all single element generated subgroups of order $1,2,n,\{x|x~\text{divides}~n\}$. Of these all of them are rotation subgroups, except for $2$ with is a mirroring. All of the rotation subgroups are normal. All other subgroups are generated by 2 elements, 1 rotation and 1 mirroring, these are just the $\{x|x~\text{divides}~n\}$ subgroups with a mirroring, and thus have order $\{2x|x~\text{divides}~n\}$. Of these, only the ones with a rotation by 1 or by 2 are normal.

For a normal rotation subgroup of order $o$ the factor group is isomorphic to $D_\frac{n}{o}$.
For a normal 2-element subgroup of order $z$ the factor group is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_\frac{n}{z}$
