\section{Minimum size generating set}

\subsection*{a) For every $k \in \mathds{N}$ there is a group that is generated by $k$ but not less than $k$ elements}

For $k \in \mathds{N}$ consider the group $G_k \leq S_{2k}$ generated by the set of disjoint transpositions $S = \{ (1,2), (3,4), \dots, (2k-1,2k) \}$. We have that
\[ G_k = \{ t_1 \cdots t_r \mid t_i \in S \wedge t_i \neq t_j \text{ for } i \neq j \} \]
is the set of all possible combinations of distinct elements of $S$ since the transpositions are disjoint and their own inverses. Thus, it holds that $|G_k| = 2^k$ as for each element in $S$ we can either use it or not use it in the product.

Suppose there exist $g_1, \dots, g_{k-1} \in G_k$ such that $G_k = \langle g_1, \dots, g_{k-1} \rangle$. Then
\[ |\langle g_1, \dots, g_{k-1} \rangle| \leq 2^{k-1} < 2^k \]
which is contradictory to the assumption that $g_1, \dots, g_{k-1}$ generate $G_k$.


\subsection*{b) Every finite group $G$ has a generating set of size $\log(|G|)$}

We assume that $\log$ is the logarithm to basis 2.

We prove the claim by induction on the group order $n$. 

If $n = 1$, then the claim follows since the trivial group is generated by the empty set.

If $n \geq 2$, let $G$ be a group of order $n$. Let $H \lneq G$ be a maximal proper subgroup of $G$. By Lagrange's Theorem we have $|H| \leq \frac{n}{2}$. By induction hypothesis there exists a generating set $S$ of $H$ of size $\log(|H|)$. Since $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, there exists an element $g \in G \setminus H$. As $H$ is maximal, for $S^\prime = S \cup \{g\}$ it holds that $\langle S^\prime \rangle = G$ and
\[ |S^\prime| = \log(|H|)+1 \leq \log(\frac{n}{2})+1 = \log(n)-\log(2)+1 = \log(n).\]


\subsection*{c) The function from b) is optimal}

To show that there exists no function $f \in o(\log(x))$ such that every finite group has a generating set of size $O(f)$, we consider the groups $G_k$ defined in a). For every $k \in \mathds{N}$ the group $G_k$ with $|G_k| = 2^k$ can not be generated by less than $k = \log(|G_k|)$ elements. Thus, such an $f$ cannot exist.
