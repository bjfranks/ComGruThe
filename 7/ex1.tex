\section{Infinite generation}
Consider the group $G = \mathds{Q}$ of the rationals numbers with addition. Clearly, $G$ is countable. Suppose $G$ is finitely generated, i.e. there is a finite set $S \subseteq \mathds{Q}$ that generates $G$. As $S$ is finite, there occur only finitely man prime factors in the denominators of $S$. Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, we can choose a prime number $p$ that is not a prime factor of any denominator in $S$. If we add two rational numbers $\frac{r_1}{s_1}$ and $\frac{r_2}{s_2}$, the denominator of the result is $s_3 := \text{lcm}(s_1,s_2)$. Thus, $s_3 \mid s_1 s_2$ and therefore $s_3$ has no prime factors that not already occur in $s_1$ or $s_2$. Hence, the rational number $\frac{1}{p}$ cannot be generated by elements of $S$, which is a contradiction to $\langle S \rangle = \mathds{Q}$.
