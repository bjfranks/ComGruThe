\section{Sizes of permutation groups and their bases}

\subsection*{a) For every $k \in \mathds{N}$ there is a group that is generated by $k$ but not less than $k$ elements}

$2^t \leq |G|$, follow from the fact that $|G|=|U^{(t)}||U^{(t-1)}|\dots|U^{(1)}|$, since all of the $|U^(i)| \geq 2$, otherwise the base would not be minimal.

$|G| \leq n^t$, follows from Lemma 3.4.6. Since, for all elements of $g,h \in G, g \neq h$, $\beta_i^g \neq \beta_i^h$, however there are only $\frac{n!}{(n-t)!} \leq n^k$ possibilities to map all the $\beta_i$.

\subsection*{b) Every finite group $G$ has a generating set of size $\log(|G|)$}

Given the result from $a)$ we have $2^t \leq |G| \leq n^t$, from this $t \leq \log(|G|) \leq t \log(n)$ from this it follows, if $t \in \mathcal{O}(\log(n)^c)$, then $\log(|G|) \in \mathcal{O}(\log(n)^{c'})$ and 
if $\log(|G|) \in \mathcal{O}(\log(n)^{c'})$, then $t \leq \log(|G|) \leq a*\log(n)^{c'}+b$, thus $t \leq a*\log(n)^{c'}+b$ and $t \in \mathcal{O}(\log(n)^{c'}$
