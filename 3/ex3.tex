To check whether a given list $S$ of elements is a generating set of a group given as list $L$, we start with the list $G = [e]$ that only contains the identity element. Then we check for every combination of elements in $G$ with elements in $S$ whether the product is already in $G$. If it is not in $G$, we add it. When we reach the last element of $G$ and the list is not extended anymore, we terminate and check whether $G$ is the whole group $L$. We do not have to take the inverses of $S$ into account since the group is finite and therefore we reach inverses after some multiplications of an element with itself.
