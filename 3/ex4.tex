\section{GAP-exercise}

We only have to check whether the given mapping extends to a well-defined map form $L1$ to $L2$ since the homomorphism property and bijectivity directly follow from this.

The algorithm first checks whether the number of elements in the generating sets and the group orders are equal. Then it determines for every generator its order in the corresponding group. If the resulting orders differ, the mapping can already not be well-defined. If the orders are the same, we determine for every element $l$ of $L1$ the combinations of generators whose product is equal to $l$. If there are two combinations that are mapped to different elements in $L2$, the element $l$ has two different images under the mapping. Thus, it is not well-defined. If all checks are successful, the mapping can be extended to an isomorphism.
