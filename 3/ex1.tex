\section{Automorphism group of the quaternion group}

Initially we know $\varphi(1)=1, \varphi(-1)=-1$. We can choose to map $i$ to any of $\{-i,j,-j,k,-k\}$, however after mapping $i$ to something negative all $\{i,j,k\}$ must be mapped to something negative, and vice versa, also we can choose to interchange all of $\{i,j,k\}$. Thus the set of Automorphisms is generated by $<(i,-i)(j,-j)(k,-k),(i,j)(-i,-j),(j,k)(-j,-k)>$
