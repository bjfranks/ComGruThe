\section{Group theoretic complexity classes}

We are given two groups $G$ and $H$, by their generators. We then compute the Normalizer of $H$ in $G$, $N_G(H)$. Now $<H^{N_G(H)}>=H$ by definition of the normailzer. From this we can compute $H \cap N_G(H)$, by 3.11.2, which contains elements from $H \cap G$, and all elements from $H \cap G \subseteq N_G(H)$ obviously, this shows the claim.
